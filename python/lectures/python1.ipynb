    "\n",
    "#### When changing to an int: \n",
    "- A float will be rounded **down** to the nearest integer when passed to the ```int()``` function. \n",
    "- ```True``` will change to $1$ when passed through ```int()```, and ```False``` to $0$.\n",
    "- You can **only** pass in digits, floats, ```True```, and ```False``` through the ```int()``` function. Anything else will error! \n",
    "\n",
    "#### When changing to a float:\n",
    "- You can only pass in numbers or booleans through a float. \n",
    "- When converted to a float, an integer 5 will become ```5.0``` and ```True``` and ```False``` will become ```1.0``` and ```0.0``` respectively\n",
    "\n",
    "#### when changing to a boolean: \n",
    "- You can pass in a string, float, or integer through the boolean function. \n",
    "- An empty string such as ```''```, the integer ```0```, or the float ```0.0``` are some examples that will return ```False```. Everything else returns ```True```."
